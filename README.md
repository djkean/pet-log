# OSRS Pet-Log

Pet-Log is a WIP project to create a fast and simple showcase for all your pets in OldSchool RuneScape.

I started this project to find a simple and effective solution to two issues:
1. Stop typing out the name of each pet you have, and how long each one took.
2. Solve the messy MS Paint formatting of DIY progress images, and create a future-proof layout.

Pet-Log will consist of two main features:
1. An image board containing all of your collection, and relevant statistics to quickly screenshot and share.
2. A form for users to submit their newly earned pets, so they can be added to the board.

The hopeful outcome is that when you want to create a graphic to share your collection, you can quickly boot up Pet-log, hit printscreen, and share your collection in just seconds.
